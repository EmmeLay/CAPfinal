            <h2> Summer Plans </h2>
			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lolesports_gamepedia_en/images/d/dd/University_of_California_San_Diegologo_square.png/revision/latest?cb=20210203220903" alt="UCSD" style="width:30%; height:40%;">
       <h3> Emmelyne is going to the University of California San Diego this fall and is majoring in Philsophy. She is excited to spend her 2024 summer traveling and working. She hopes to work on Larchmont. She is planning on traveling in July, though she does not know where she wants to travel to yet.</h3>
	   <h2> Skills Gained </h2>
	   <h3>Emmelyne reached new levels of understanding with coding this past school year. She is much more fluent in a wider variety of coding languages, and also has a more nuanced understanding of certain websites she was previously familiar coding on, such as Code.org and Scratch. Working on Github and having to create programs without blocks assisted in her comprehension of the procedures and programs on a deeper and more complete level.</h3>
	   <h2> Future Career </h2>
	   <h3>She hopes to be either an author or a Philosophy professor when she is older. She wants to work in California, New York, or Amsterdam. If not working in the field of Philosophy, she would enjoy working in museums or the film industry. Her coding knowledge can help her with these different careers, espcially film, as technology is increasingly prevalent in all aspects of society. Whether she is writing a book online, assigning her students homework on a website, or editing a movie, she will use her knowledge of websites, servers, and html in the future.</h3>
